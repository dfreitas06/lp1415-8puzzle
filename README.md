# 8 Puzzle

### Programming Logic Project

This project consists in creating a Prolog program that implements the 8 Puzzle game.

This game consists in a 3x3 square grid in which you have the numbers 1 to 8 scrambled and one empty slot and you have to order the numbers starting from the upper left corner to the right until you are left with the solved puzzle with the empty slot on the lower right corner and the numbers in the correct position.
